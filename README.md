# OOPshoppingSystem

"TechShop" is a comprehensive Java project built on Object-Oriented Programming principles, featuring a Swing-based GUI for an intuitive shopping experience. The system encompasses all aspects of a typical shop, enabling customers to browse products, add them to their basket, proceed to checkout, and make payments securely. Simultaneously, administrators have full control over the inventory, with the ability to view stock levels, add new products, update existing ones, and manage orders efficiently.

The user interface is designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, offering customers a seamless shopping journey and administrators a convenient platform for inventory management. Leveraging Java's OOP capabilities, the project maintains a clean and modular codebase, facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.

Included in the project folder is a comprehensive PDF detailing the UML class diagram, providing a visual representation of the system's architecture and relationships between different components. This diagram serves as a valuable resource for developers to understand the project's structure and make informed decisions during development and future enhancements.
